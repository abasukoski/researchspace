The size of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object ranges from more than 99% of an instance of F2 Expression to tiny bits (a few words from a text, one bar from a musical composition, one detail from a still image, a two-second clip from a video, etc.). An instance of E90 Symbolic Object can become a fragment of an instance of F2 Expression through the deterioration over time of a carrier of the expression, such as when only fragments of a manuscript of an ancient text survive. Typically instances of E90 Symbolic Object that are of interest as fragments of expressions are formed deliberately, such as when excerpts are taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts, or citations from one expression are used in another text."@en;

An instance of F2 Expression is considered to be created when it is captured on a carrier other than the creator’s brain. Although F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an instance of F3 Manifestation and an instance of F5 Item. F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the E18 Physical Thing that serves as the carrier. The creation of an instance of F2 Expression coincides with the creation of the first instance of F3 Manifestation that R4 embodies (is embodied in) this instance of F2 Expression. The P2 has type (is type of) property can be used to specify the type of the instance of F28 Expression Creation (i.e., activities such as translating, revising, or arranging music are types of creation process). The type of the process is distinct from the type of result even though the typology frequently used for instances of the resulting F2 Expressions may imply the category of the instance of the F28 Expression Creation. An instance of F28 Expression Creation may use as source material one or more specific instances of F2 Expression.

As a result, all the instances of F5 Item associated with a given instance of F3 Manifestation are expected to carry the content defined in that instance of F3 Manifestation, although some or even all of them may happen to carry a content that significantly differs from it, due to either an accident in the course of industrial production, or subsequent physical modification or degradation. An instance of F5 Item that consists of a physical object or set of objects with clear physical boundaries is also an instance of E22 Human-Made Object. An instance of F5 Item that is stored on a part of a larger physical support (such as an electronic file among others on a disc) can also be considered to be an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. The notion of F5 Item is only relevant with regard to the production process, from a bibliographic point of view. The physical units managed by cultural heritage institutions in their holdings are a distinct notion: a unit of holdings certainly can be equal to an instance of F5 Item, but it also can be either “bigger” than one (e.g., when two instances of F5 Item are bound together (in the case of printed books)), or “smaller” than one (e.g., for incomplete holdings, such as when only one CD from a two-CD set is held). From an operational point of view, cultural heritage institutions typically do not manage instances of F5 Item, but physical holdings units, instances of E19 Physical Object, although for libraries in most cases this is not significant because each item corresponds with a single unit. When this is not the case, the linkage between items and the units relevant for collection management can be recorded through the P46 is composed of (forms part of) property between instances of F5 Item and instances of E19 Physical Object.

Typical examples are novels that can be grouped by fictional universes or common characters, paintings or graphical works that exist as a family of alternatives, musical compositions that are referred to as the same although they exist as particular versions that are each identified as an individual work. The instance of E28 Conceptual Object that has works as members will often be constructed for a specific purpose, such as bibliographic organization or retrieval."@en;

    rdfs:comment "This class comprises distinct intellectual ideas conveyed in artistic and intellectual creations, such a poems, stories or musical compositions. A Work is the outcome of an intellectual process of one or more persons. Inherent to the notion of work is the existence of recognisable realizations of the work in the form of one or more expressions. Works are often regarded as finished and discrete e.g. when declared as such by the creator of the work or based on the elaboration or logical coherence of its content. However, works may be recognized as existing but unfinished e.g. if the creators deliberately or accidentally never explicitly finished a particular Expression but have left behind partial expressions. In the absence of explicit information about the initial conception, which is rarely available, the first expression created constitutes witness of the beginning of existence of a Work. A Work can evolve over time, such as through revised editions. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously, in parallel, or over time. Additional expressions of a Work can continue to be created over time. The boundaries of a Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. The main purpose of this class is to enable bringing together intellectually equivalent Expressions in order to display to a user all available alternatives of the same intellectual or artistic content."@en .

    rdfs:comment "This class comprises activities by which instances of F1 Work come into existence. An instance of F27 Work Creation can serve to document the period a work was coming into existence and the circumstances of it, when these are known. An instance of F27 Work Creation marks the initial creation of an instance of F1 Work through expressions or other externalisations that are sufficiently elaborated so that the characteristic conceptual identity of the work could be recognized as existing. In many cases this will coincide with the first known complete externalisation of an expression of the work. In other cases, the initial creation of an instance of F1 Work may be inferred from multiple, or later, expressions or other forms of evidence. For instance, commissioning of a work may explicitly be agreed on after the presentation of an already complete and detailed elaboration of the work that was not made public. Performances may be prior to written expressions, as in the case of Shakespeare’s works. The work, as an intellectual construction, may evolve from its initial creation onwards, until the last known expression of it. An instance of E39 Actor with which a work is associated through the chain of properties F1 Work. R16i was created by: F27 Work Creation.

    rdfs:comment "This class comprises associations between an instance of any class, and signs or arrangements of signs that are used to refer to and identify that instance. Signs include alphanumeric characters, ideograms, notations such as chemical structure symbols, sound symbols, etc. The scripts or type sets for the symbols used to compose an instance of F12 Nomen have to be sufficiently specified. Spelling variants are regarded as different nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity. An arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation until it is associated with something in some context. In that sense, the F12 Nomen class can be understood as the reification of a relationship between an instance of E1 CRM Entity and an instance of E41 Appellation. Two instances of F12 Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to distinct instances of E1 CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of F12 Nomen referring to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties of the F12 Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different controlled vocabularies). An instance of F12 Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of E1 CRM Entity on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of F12 Nomen establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of E62 String that is associated with it. Depending on context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, homonymy is avoided. Instances of F12 Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of E1 CRM Entity either formally (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage. When they are assigned formally, the construction of the instances of E62 String that represent them may follow predetermined rules."@en;

The substance of F2 Expression is signs. An Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time. Expressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account. The form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new F2 Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions. An instance of F2 Expression which includes spoken or written text may be multiply instantiated as an instance of E33 Linguistic Object. This allows for the association of the E56 Language of the text with the instance of F2 Expression by using the property P72 has language (is language of) ."@en;

The substance of F3 Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted. An F3 Manifestation is the outcome of a publication process where one or more F2 Expressions are prepared for public dissemination, but it may also be a unique form created directly on some material carrier without the intent of being formally published. An instance of F3 Manifestation typically incorporates one or more instances of F2 Expression representing a distinct logical content and all additional input by a publisher such as text layout and cover design. Additionally an F3 Manifestation can be identified by the physical features for the medium of distribution, if applicable. For example, publications in the form of hard-cover and paperback editions would be two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation, even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications. In the case of industrial products such as printed books or music CDs, but also digital material, an instance of F3 Manifestation can be regarded as the prototype for all copies of it. In these cases, an instance of F3 Manifestation specifies all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item display in order to be copies of a particular publication. In the case of industrial products, instances of F3 Manifestation are also instances of E99 Product Type, normally nowadays identified by characteristic identifiers such as ISBN numbers."@en;

    rdfs:comment "This class comprises recognizable groups or organizations of persons that have the potential of acting as a unit to produce some intentional result of bibliographic interest for which they can be collectively considered responsible. A group of people becomes an instance of F55 Collective Agent when it identifies itself by a name that identifies it within an appropriate context and exhibits sufficient organizational characteristics to permit it to perform actions that reflect agency. Groups that are constituted as meetings, conferences, congresses, expeditions, festivals, fairs, etc. are examples of F55 Collective Agent as long as they self-identify by a specific name, rather than being referred to by a generic description of the gathering, and can act as a unit (such as by publishing their proceedings, or approving a report). These collective actions may be performed by representatives selected by the whole, rather than by all individual members acting together. Collective Agents may be members of other Collective Agents, although directly or indirectly all Collective Agents are composed of persons. The membership of many types of Collective Agents will continue to evolve over time. A Collective Agent may continue to exist even if it has no members for a time (for example, a committee whose members all resign prior to the expiration of their terms but then a new complement of members is appointed). Instances of F55 Collective Agent include instances of its subclass F11 Corporate Body: commercial or corporate entities and other legally registered bodies, as well as organizations and associations, musical, artistic or performing groups, governments, and any of their sub-units. Married couples and other concepts of family (instances of F39 Family) are instances of a subclass of F55 Collective Agent. In the wider sense, this class also comprises holders of official positions viewed collectively, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it is possible that the instance of F55 Collective Agent has only ever had a single member. A group of persons known by/using a joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually adopted as a persona by two or more people acting together) is a case of F55 Collective Agent."@en .

It is normally inferred from the values attributed to instances of F2 Expression that realize the work and that are considered canonical or best representative of the work.
